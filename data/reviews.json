            "text": "Say hello 👋 to my dear friend Natalie Trautman Newman I often referred to Nat as my “silver lining” friend.<br/>            I met her shortly after Luke was diagnosed with cancer, and we were both training for a marathon in San Francisco through #teamintraining with LLS. Needless to say, our lives have come full circle from meeting when we were fighting to hold onto Luke 🙏🏻, and now paying it forward to help others with their health and wellness. ❤️<br/>            Natalie is a beautiful friend,  nurse, Breast Cancer navigator, and is a true example of what it looks like to “work” Plexus And enjoy it as a business opportunity.<br/>            <br/>            Thanks for sharing your story Natalie! I’m so grateful our paths crossed all those years ago! 🙏🏻<br/>            <br/>            👇🏻👇🏻<br/>            <br/>            “💫Because of Plexus, I have paid off $7,000 in credit card debt,  while at the same time significantly increasing my bank savings account. <br/>            💫Because of Plexus I did not have  to worry about medical bills for my beloved fur baby as she developed health issues in her last couple of years and required multiple meds. I was able to provide the best care possible. <br/>            💫Because of Plexus I have met an incredible group of friends who have been there for me through good times and bad. We walk side by side supporting each other as we work toward our dreams. <br/>            💫Because of Plexus I have had the joy of helping friends and family get healthy and positively impact their health for years to come!”<br/>            <br/>            So thankful for you and all those you are able to help Natalie!!\""

            "text": "Say 👋 to my friend Susan! <br/>I have Ava to thank for this beautiful story 😉 Susan was Ava‘s resource teacher years ago and introduced the 2 of us, and the happily ever after Plexus story that continues to unfold… It would be near impossible to ever pick a “favorite” testimony story, they are all beautiful in and of themselves #justlikekids 🙂 <br/>But this one certainly hits my heart.  Susan is a beautiful example of what commitment, and belief in her products look like  She trusted her “gut” and how much better she was feeling, long before she trusted the scale.  #itsjustanumber  In my eyes, she is a Plexus poster child, committed to the process, belief in herself and went ALL IN to make things happen.  <br/>Take a peak at what comes with using products consistently, incorporating the #gym when she was ready to “up her game” and fight for better health and wellness!!! Take a peek at her pictures in the comments for more w😍w moments!!! <br/><br/>👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻<br/><br/>“Full disclosure here…these two pics were taken exactly 1 year apart…Christmas Day 2020 vs. Christmas Day 2021. <br/><br/>I was at the age where I was beginning to get several baseline tests done before the real aging began and I didn’t like what I saw, heard, and/or read. Numbers not where I wanted them, osteopenia in the hips (told to start weight training which I had NEVER really done) and the scale constantly creeping up and up with very little change in what I ate.  This couldn’t really be happening to me!   I’ve got a lot of living to do yet.  So, bring on March 2020 as I took the first step into a gym to meet with a highly recommended trainer, thank you @angelabeckius at OurFitClub!  She had me starting the next day, WHAT?  🤷‍♀️<br/>No time like the present!!   That was the real beginning of my transformation journey.  Since March (9 months time) I have entered that same gym at least 3-4 times each week. I have gained so much knowledge about myself, #fitness, confidence, the importance of #supplementation and a whole community of like minded supportive people! <br/><br/>I have also been very consistent with my Plexus products…a healthy gut is a happy gut! Because of Plexus I have found #migraine relief, I use the bathroom daily 💩, #sleep like a teenager and have the #energy to keep up with my intermediate 5th and 6th grade students *and keep a smile on my face while doing so!!!<br/>Since last March, I have also lost inches and pounds…but this is just the beginning!  2022 marks a major birthday for me and I still have goals to meet before then!<br/><br/>So I say, just start, trust the process and be #consistent.  That’s the best gift you can give to yourself and your loved ones!  Stay tuned!”<br/><br/>SUSAN - WAY 👏🏻TO 👏🏻GO!!!! Your story and all those you now help is beyond inspiring! So proud of you!"

My sponsor educated, supported, validated, and gave me a visual of how great the products can work. Four months later I feel clean with my diet, refreshed during the day, I look forward to tasting the different flavors, and most of all, I can share my success with my wife.  She has her own products to meet her goals and she likes how she feels as well.  I would highly recommend Plexus to anyone and they will also be supported and educated.  Please trust me. It's well worth the money and you can actually save money on promotions that come out at least once a month. <br/><br/>Thank you, Vicky”<br/><br/>Congratulations Tony! So happy for you and Kristy!! And thankful we had the opportunity to connect through Angie at the gym!!"

            "text": "I  L O V E sharing health testimonies of my friends as we close out the year.  Sharing how the business works for my friends is equally as rewarding!!!  Many people who “Plexus” earn cash back on their very own products, if they #choose. Others bring just a few friends with them and get their products paid for.  After all, getting healthy is more fun with friends 🙂. <br/>And others go “all in” and use their Plexus income to chase down their #dreams, and do things they never imagined possible.  There is a little bit of everything sprinkled throughout my organization, which is what makes this such a wonderful opportunity. 😍 After all, when you find something that works, it’s hard not to share with your friends! <br/><br/>So tonight, I would like to introduce you to my friend Angela Quednau Beckius  Many of you know her as my personal trainer Extraordinaire 💪🏻<br/>She works her tail off to help others, EVERY day.  Walk through her doors and you can count on a workout that will knock your 🧦 off, and walk out understanding more about what YOU are capable of doing, #nutrition and the importance of #supplementation.  <br/><br/>Her current gym ROCKS….but wait, there’s more👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻<br/><br/>“Because of Plexus, not only am I able to pay my gym rent, but now I am able to chase down my dreams, EXPAND my gym and partner opening this space next door to offer a more enhanced, concierge fitness studio for my community.  👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Dreams really do come true.  THANK YOU PLEXUS!!!!!!”<br/><br/>Ang - HUGE congratulations!! I cannot wait for your new space to open!!!! We are so lucky to have you! 🙂 #whyiplexus<br/><br/>Friends - a lot of the testimonies you will see on my page these next few weeks, are also friends who work out with Angie.  Bring the 2 together -  and W😍W!!!!"

Casey and I went to college together, and we had not spoken in decades, until #enterPlexus. ☺️<br/>This story means more to me than words could ever express and is #WhyIPlexus <br/>I❤️myjob<br/>👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻<br/><br/>“The scale victory is magnificent. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻<br/>All 150 pounds of it!!! <br/>But let me tell you all the things you cannot see.<br/><br/>I am able to be the dad I want to be again. I’m a participant in my life, versus watching my life go by. And I have the joy that comes with waking up every day free from pain, free from medication, eager to live. I’m active and more happy than I have ever been! All because I said yes, and because I decided yo make a change. Vicky said “trust me”, so I did. And have never looked back. <br/><br/>What’s the magic, you ask? No magic.  This is what happens with trusting the process, being coachable, products that work #science staying consistent, drinking my water, beginning to move my body again, and patience. <br/><br/>Was it easy? Nope. Plexus is a tool, not a quick fix. Heal your gut, get your blood sugars balanced, address inflammation, and make slow and steady lifestyle shifts. <br/>Plexus WILL change your life. Plexus works. Period. <br/><br/>I watched Vicky for years, until I decided it was MY time. I’m so glad I did. ALL the good things in life are worth fighting for, your health being one of them!!!  If I can do it, trust me, you can too! Make the call friends, make the change! You won’t be sorry!”"

Thank you Holly for trusting me, trusting your gut;) and saying YES to Plexus. <br/>👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻<br/><br/>“Hi Vicky! Just wanted to tell you how well we are doing with plexus. I have reached my goal weight and find myself having a lot more energy! I use the TriPlex system daily and then about a month ago added in MetaBurn and have lost inches around my waist. My jeans and clothes are fitting very nice these days! My husband even had to go to a tighter belt hole as he has slimmed down! “<br/><br/>👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 so happy for you Holly!! Thank you for sharing ❤️"

I really like Bioclense because it truly lets you know when you have eaten something not so good for your body 😊 I love slim bc it helps me not over eat and not want sugar. I like Metaburn because it gives me that little extra boost I need. I can literally feel the products working in my body and love it! <br/><br/>- K T"
